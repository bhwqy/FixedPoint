# Fixed Point Number

This is my implementation of fixed point number.

To use the library, just include the directory.

The max error of atan2 by fixed number is 2e-4 in rad and at least 30% faster than std::atan2. See the src/test

## TODO

1. implement math library for fixed point number
2. use template to implement fixed point number
